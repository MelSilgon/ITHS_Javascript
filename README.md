# School Project - Javascript

My individual project for the school's Javascript course. <br>
The API I chose to fetch from was <a href="https://metmuseum.github.io/">The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API</a><br>
I also chose to work with the school's own API (Cities) and on the "Cities" page you can Post, Put & Delete a city.
